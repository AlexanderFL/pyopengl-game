# About

The project is split into 2 parts, the game client and the game server. They are seperate components and should be run as such. Each folder has a README.md file that explains how the project is started. This project is originally a school project for Reykjavik University.

## game-client
Game client has all of the graphical implementation and is what the client interacts with.

## game-server
Contains the server that can be started and exposed to the internet for clients to connect to.
