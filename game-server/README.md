# Game server

Developed using Python 3.9.0

## Setup
First, be located within the same file this README.md is located in
Using python virtual environments is highly recommended

- Setup venv `py -m venv server-venv` && `./server-venv/Scripts/activate`
- Install modules `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the server `python ./Server.py`

All done! Use CTRL+C to stop the server (might need to spam it a bit)
